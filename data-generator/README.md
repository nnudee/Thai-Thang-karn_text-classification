# Synthetic Data Generation

This open-source package includes a synthetic data generator and a [companion app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Intel/synthetic-data-generator) that use a language model to create data based on specified categories and labels. By using this package, you can generate your own synthetic data for various use cases, such as training and testing machine learning models. The synthetic data generator can be run on [Intel® Tiber™ AI Cloud](https://cloud.intel.com/) using an Intel® Xeon® CPU instance. This platform provides ample computing resources ensuring smooth execution of your code.

## Article

Visit [Synthetic Data Generation with Language Models: A Practical Guide](https://medium.com/p/0ff98eb226a1) to learn about the implementation of this package. For more AI development how-to content, visit [Intel® AI Development Resources](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/artificial-intelligence/overview.html).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.

3. Install the required packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Add your Hugging Face token to a file named `token.txt` in the project directory.

## Preparation to Run on Intel Tiber AI Cloud

1. Visit <https://cloud.intel.com/> and sign up.

2. Go to the "Learning" tab and click "Connect now" to launch JupyterLab*.

## Usage

To run the synthetic data generator, use a variation of the following command:

```sh
python sdg.py --sample_size 100 --batch_size 20 --output_dir ./output --model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --save_reasoning
```

### Arguments

- `--sample_size`: The number of samples generated by the language model (default: 100).
- `--labels`: The labels used to classify the synthetic data.
- `--label_descriptions`: A description of the meaning of each label.
- `--categories_types`: The categories and their types for data generation and diversification.
- `--use_case`: The use case of the synthetic data to provide context for the language model.
- `--prompt_examples`: The examples used in the Few-Shot or Chain-of-Thought prompting.
- `--model`: The language model for data generation (default: `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`).
- `--max_new_tokens`: The maximum number of new tokens to generate for each sample (default: 256).
- `--batch_size`: The batch size for saving generated samples to file (default: 20).
- `--output_dir`: The output directory (default: `./`).
- `--save_reasoning`: Enable save reasoning (default: False).

## Configuration

The configuration for labels, label descriptions, categories, and other parameters is stored in the `sdg_config.py` file. Make sure to update this file with your specific configuration.

Example `sdg_config.py`:

```python
labels = ["Label1", "Label2", "Label3"]
label_descriptions = "Description of labels"
categories_types = {
    "Category1": ["Type1", "Type2"],
    "Category2": ["Type3", "Type4"]
}
use_case = "Your use case"
prompt_examples = "Examples for the Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought prompt."
```

## Functions

- `read_token() -> None`

Reads a Hugging Face token from a file named 'token.txt' and logs in using the token. (See [Article](#article) to learn how to create and access your Hugging Face token.)

The file is expected to be located in the same directory as the script. If the file is missing, inaccessible, or another error occurs, the program will terminate with an appropriate error message.

- `validate_positive_integer(value: str) -> int`

Validates that the input string, provided via command-line arguments, represents a positive integer.

- `parse_string(input_string: str) -> Tuple[str, str]`

Parses a string containing `OUTPUT:` and `REASONING:` sections and extracts their values.

- `sdg(sample_size: int, labels: List[str], label_descriptions: str, categories_types: Dict[str, str], use_case: str, prompt_examples: str, batch_size: int, output_dir: str, model: str, save_reasoning: bool) -> None`

Generates synthetic data based on specified categories and labels.

- `main()`
The main function that parses command-line arguments and runs the synthetic data generator.
